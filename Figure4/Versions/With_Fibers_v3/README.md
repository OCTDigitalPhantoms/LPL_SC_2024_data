This is an extra OCT numerical phantom not used in the paper. However, it is generated with approach described here:

Lev A Matveev, Alexander A Sovetsky, Alexander L Matveyev, I Alex Vitkin, Maher Assaad and Vladimir Y Zaitsev Refined speckle contrast estimation in OCT based on compensation of scattering-related distortions of speckle pattern parameters Laser Physics Letters 22(1), 015601 (2025) https://doi.org/10.1088/1612-202X/ad9149

So, when using for your purposes, please cite the above-mentioned paper.

The OCT digital phantom cloud-based simulation tool can be found on the OpticElastograph platform: https://www.opticelastograph.com/

You may feed the Scatterers-*.dat file and the parameters from Configuration.ini into the OCT scan generation tool. To avoid server overload, registration is required. You can sign up and request full access to the platform by contacting the authors via email.
